This game is in a Game-Jam theme that Meta.AI suggested to me.
"The Tower's Secret": Build a game uncovering secrets in a vertical world.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: Build an HTML, CSS, JavaScript game for mobile devices in portrait-mode. The game is called "The Tower's Secret". The player uncovers secrets in a vertical world, that climbs upwards in a tall tower, and delves downwards into a deep mineshaft. Incorporate any game elements you think would be exciting, fun, and addictive to play and continue progressing. If possible, can you also make the game elements in an Object-Oriented structure? Let me know if thereâ€™s a preferred folder structure too. Thanks!

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code, and I noticed it used keyboard controls, so I asked it for some modifications.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:

This game will have a player that can move up or down in the tower and mineshaft, collecting coins and power-ups while avoiding obstacles.

Game Mechanics
1. Player Movement (keyboard controllers): Use the up and down arrow keys to move the player.
    - For mobile devices, virtual buttons or touch controls are necessary since arrow keys aren't available.
2. Coin Collection: Collect coins to increase score.
3. Obstacles: Avoid obstacles to prevent game over.
4. Power-Ups: Collect power-ups for temporary invincibility.
5. Scoring: Score increases with coin collection.
Future Enhancements
1. Levels: Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
2. Enemies: Introduce moving enemies for added challenge.
3. Boss Battles: Create boss battles at level ends.
4. Upgrades: Allow players to upgrade abilities and appearance.
5. Mobile Optimization: Enhance mobile controls and performance.
This basic game structure provides a solid foundation for expansion and refinement.
